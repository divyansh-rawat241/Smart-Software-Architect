"""Curated real-world architecture precedent matching.

Design rationale:
  This module matches the recommended architecture's score vector against a
  small curated set of well-known, publicly documented systems using weighted
  distance in criteria-space. It grounds an abstract recommendation in real
  industry precedent rather than a generic label such as "microservices".
  Case facts are intentionally broad and public; matching is deterministic.
  Similarity scores are algorithmic distances between score vectors, not
  measurements of any company's internal systems.
