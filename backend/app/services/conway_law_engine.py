"""Deterministic Conway's Law fit analysis with architecture-specific roles.

Design rationale:
  Conway's Law says that system structure mirrors communication structure.
  This module first produces an auditable staffing plan for the architecture,
  then tests its component and service boundaries against those recommended
  roles. No LLM is involved: role allocation, ownership, and friction all use
  fixed catalog entries and capacity-ratio rules.
