"""Whole-project reasoning for the architecture assistant.

The deterministic layer in ``assistant_intel`` handles the model of record —
listing, counting, adding, renaming, deleting. This module handles the
questions a design partner is actually asked: does the API surface cover the
requirements, where is the single point of failure, why is this technology
here, is the recommended style justified, what breaks if traffic grows tenfold.

Every answer is computed from the workspace: the requirement model, the causal
graph, the architecture options and their comparison scorecards, the API and
database designs, the deployment plan, the prototype and the recorded ADRs.
Nothing is asserted that the project does not support, and each claim is
labelled Confirmed, Inferred, Recommendation or Unknown so the reader can tell
a fact from an opinion.
