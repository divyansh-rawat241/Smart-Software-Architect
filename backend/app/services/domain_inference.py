"""Deterministic, domain-agnostic inference utilities for the generation pipeline.

Design rationale:
  Downstream generators (APIs, data model, deployment, diagrams, staffing)
  must derive their content from the actual project brief instead of falling
  back to a generic e-commerce template. This module centralizes the reusable
  building blocks for that: role/entity/capability/integration extraction from
  raw prose, domain-family classification, constraint normalization, bounded
  context clustering, and evidence gating for commerce-sensitive assumptions.

  Everything here is deterministic and uses generic English/vocabulary rules.
  No business domain is hardcoded: families are broad categories scored by
  vocabulary evidence, and all extracted terms come from the user's own text.
