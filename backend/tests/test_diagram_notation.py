"""UML notation correctness for every diagram, across unrelated domains.

The diagram generators were only ever read against one EV charging project.
Checking a second domain immediately turned up defects that were invisible
there: an activity diagram that was a star graph, a sequence diagram naming an
actor "Needs clarification", and a deployment diagram drawing "Replicas: 2" as
a deployed thing with an arrow into the deployment model.

So these tests are parametrised over five briefs that share no vocabulary.
Every assertion is about *notation* — the rules of the diagram type — rather
than about domain words, because a rule that only holds for one domain is not a
rule. Domain grounding is asserted separately, per brief, at the end.
