# ArchAI - Software Architecture Decision Engine

## What ArchAI Does

ArchAI is a web application that takes a plain-English project brief and automatically generates a complete software architecture package. You describe what you want to build, and ArchAI produces:

- Structured requirements (actors, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints)
- Three architecture alternatives (Modular Monolith, Microservices, Serverless) with weighted comparison scores
- Seven UML diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Class, ER, Component, Deployment)
- Database schema design with SQL DDL
- REST API endpoint specifications
- Deployment recommendations (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Exportable Markdown and PDF reports

## How It Works - The Pipeline

When a user submits a project brief, ArchAI runs a 9-step generation pipeline:

```
1. Requirement Analyzer   -->  Extracts actors, features, constraints from the brief
2. Clarification Engine   -->  Identifies gaps, generates follow-up questions
3. Architecture Generator -->  Creates 3 architecture alternatives
4. Comparison Engine      -->  Scores each architecture on 12 weighted metrics
5. Recommendation Engine  -->  Picks the best option with reasoning
6. Database Generator     -->  Generates entity-relationship schema + SQL DDL
7. API Generator          -->  Designs REST endpoint specifications
8. Deployment Generator   -->  Recommends infrastructure and deployment strategy
9. Diagram Generator      -->  Produces 7 UML diagrams (Mermaid + PlantUML)
```

After this, a Documentation Generator compiles everything into a Markdown report and PDF.

### Domain-Aware Generation

The system recognizes four domains out of the box:
- **EV Charging Booking Platform** - stations, chargers, bookings, sessions, payments
- **Online Pharmacy** - products, prescriptions, orders, inventory, shipments
- **E-Commerce** - products, orders, payments, shipments
- **Generic Digital Platform** - fallback for any other domain

Each domain has pre-built templates for requirements, database entities, API endpoints, and diagrams. For unrecognized domains, the system uses a generic fallback that adapts based on keywords in the brief.

### Optional LLM Refinement

If Ollama is running locally with the `qwen3:8b` model, ArchAI sends the rule-based outputs to the LLM for optional refinement (improving specificity and detail). If Ollama is unavailable, the system works perfectly on rule-based generation alone.

## Workspace Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Creation
1. User enters a project brief (title, description, business context, budget, cloud preference, constraints)
2. Backend analyzes the brief and extracts requirements
3. If the system detects gaps, it generates clarification questions
4. All artifacts are generated (architectures, diagrams, DB schema, APIs, deployment plan, documentation)

### Phase 2: Clarification
1. User answers the follow-up questions (e.g., authentication method, payment integration, SLA targets)
2. Backend merges answers and regenerates all artifacts with improved accuracy
3. Completeness score updates

### Phase 3: Exploration
1. **Requirements** - View actors, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints
2. **Architecture** - Compare 3 alternatives side by side with per-metric scores
3. **Diagrams** - Browse 7 diagram types rendered from Mermaid syntax
4. **Report** - Read the full Markdown documentation or export as PDF

### Phase 4: Iteration (Change Requests)
1. User submits a change request (e.g., "add real-time notifications")
2. `ImpactAnalyzer` determines which modules are affected
3. Only affected services re-run (not the entire pipeline)
4. Impact history is tracked

## Architecture Comparison System

ArchAI scores each architecture on 12 metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Scalability | How well it handles growth |
| Performance | Response time and throughput |
| Maintainability | Ease of code changes |
| Security | Auth, data protection, compliance |
| Cost | Infrastructure and development cost |
| Reliability | Uptime and failure handling |
| Availability | Target uptime achievement |
| Deployment Complexity | How hard it is to deploy |
| Learning Curve | Team ramp-up time |
| Development Time | Speed to first release |
| Fault Isolation | Blast radius of failures |
| Operational Complexity | Day-to-day management overhead |

Weights are adjusted based on the project's scale profile:
- **Startup scale** - favors lower cost, faster development, simpler deployment
- **Growth scale** - balanced weights
- **High scale** - favors scalability, availability, fault isolation

## Database Design

Single `workspaces` table stores everything as JSON columns:

| Column | Contents |
|---|---|
| `requirements_json` | Actors, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints |
| `clarification_json` | Questions, answers, completeness score |
| `architectures_json` | 3 architecture options with components, tech stacks, pros/cons |
| `comparison_json` | 12-metric scorecards with weights |
| `recommendation_json` | Best architecture choice with reasoning |
| `diagrams_json` | 7 diagram artifacts (Mermaid + PlantUML syntax) |
| `database_design_json` | Entities, relationships, SQL DDL |
| `api_design_json` | Endpoint specifications |
| `deployment_plan_json` | Infrastructure recommendations |
| `documentation_markdown` | Full Markdown report |
| `impact_history_json` | Change request audit trail |

---

## Frontend Pages

| Page | Route | What It Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Create project briefs, view workspace summary, answer clarifications |
| Requirements | `/wizard` | Actors, functional/non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions |
| Architecture | `/architecture` | Comparison table, architecture selector, component flow, tech stack, trade-offs |
| Comparison | `/comparison` | Radar chart visualization, scoring rationale, full scorecard table |
| Diagrams | `/diagrams` | 7 diagram types with Mermaid rendering, source toggle, PNG export |
| Report | `/docs` | Markdown report with Markdown/PDF download buttons |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Rule-based generation as primary, LLM as optional refinement** - The system works without any AI model. Templates and keyword matching generate complete outputs. Ollama improves specificity but is never required.

2. **Single-table JSON storage** - All workspace data lives in one table with JSON columns. This simplifies the schema and makes it easy to serialize/deserialize complex nested structures.

3. **Impact-aware regeneration** - Change requests don't regenerate everything. The `ImpactAnalyzer` maps keywords to affected modules and only re-runs those services.

4. **Dual diagram syntax** - Every diagram is generated in both Mermaid (for in-browser rendering) and PlantUML (for external tooling).

5. **Domain-aware templates** - Pre-built blueprints for EV Charging, Online Pharmacy, and E-Commerce domains produce more accurate outputs than generic generation.
